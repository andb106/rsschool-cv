## About me
I'm a traffic engineer with more than 10 years experience. 
I want to learn javascript and use it at my work. I think learning  web development is a good way to do this. 
And, probably, I will learn a new profession - front-end developer.
## Skills
- python (basics)
- javascript (basics)
- vscode
## Code example
```
function sum (numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0)
};
```
